# ng-memory-match-2020

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.0 using NativeScript schematics for web - mobile code sharing.

This improves on TNG's previous memory match app in
- code sharing for web and mobile
- pulling data from our API (as opposed to packaging data client-side)
- Enhanced styling, UI, and UX
